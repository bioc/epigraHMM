Description: epigraHMM provides a set of tools for the analysis of epigenomic data 
    based on hidden Markov Models. It contains two separate peak callers, one for consensus peaks
    from biological/technical replicates, and and one for differial peaks from multi-replicate 
    multi-condition experiments. For the latter, window-specific posterior probabilities associated 
    with read count enrichment for every possible combinatorial pattern are provided.
